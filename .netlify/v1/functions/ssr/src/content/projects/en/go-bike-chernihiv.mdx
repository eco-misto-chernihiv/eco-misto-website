  <Badge>The Process</Badge>
The "Go Bike Chernihiv" project was launched by the NGOs Eco Misto and Agency of Urban Initiatives in response to the growing interest in cycling as fuel shortages intensified. The #BikesForUkraine campaign quickly gained momentum — we began receiving used European bicycles from partners for repair and distribution among selected groups within the region. Communities selected through an open call received expert assessments of their cycling infrastructure and strategic development plans. Specifically, the Nizhyn, Varva, and Kulykivka communities received refurbished European bicycles, bike racks, and maintenance stations.

This initiative improved access to bicycles for volunteers, critical infrastructure workers, and other residents — helping reduce transportation pressure, lower emissions, and promote sustainable mobility. The project also launched the social bike repair workshop "Velokukhnia in Chernihiv" — an innovative space where locals can access professional tools to repair their bikes for free. Volunteers at the workshop have already repaired 240 European bikes, which have been distributed to social workers, medics, humanitarian volunteers, and paramedics. Such community bike repair spaces are a novelty in Ukraine — and still rare even across Europe.

Chernihiv’s cycling infrastructure was significantly upgraded: bike racks were installed at schools, hospitals, post offices, and other key public locations, while four neighborhoods received new self-service repair stations. We also organized a number of large-scale events: a patriotic bike ride, the "Ladies on Bikes" parade, and volunteer rides to de-occupied communities to deliver humanitarian aid.

All these activities aim to foster a culture of sustainable transportation in the Chernihiv region and promote the bicycle as a primary mode of transport.
