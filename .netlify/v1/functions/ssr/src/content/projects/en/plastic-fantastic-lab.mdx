  <Badge>The Process</Badge>
Plastic Fantastic Lab is an interdisciplinary maker initiative aimed at strengthening engineering, design, and artistic communities to tackle the global issue of plastic pollution through two local workshops in Chernihiv and Kyiv.

The project focuses on building infrastructure for plastic recycling based on open-source designs from Precious Plastic. Partner organizations adapted the open blueprints and built shredders, an extruder, and a heat press, enabling a full recycling cycle — from collection and shredding to production.

As part of the project, 20 hands-on workshops were held for students of technical disciplines and young people eager to grow in the fields of recycling and eco-making. Residents of the spaces worked on building tools, explored new technologies, and took part in internships at partner sites.

These educational workshops are envisioned to become full-fledged social enterprises aimed at tackling plastic pollution. Their services will range from crafted design products and practical goods to construction materials and custom-built equipment.

The "Makers Innovation Award" is organized by betterplace lab gGmbH and Future Challenges e.V. as part of #TOLOCAR, a project component of "Good Governance through GovTech and Transparency in Ukraine", funded by the German Federal Government and implemented by GIZ in close cooperation with Ukrainian and international partners.
