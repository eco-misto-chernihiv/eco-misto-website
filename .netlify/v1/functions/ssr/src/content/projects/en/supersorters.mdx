  <Badge>The Process</Badge>

The project included educational, info rmational, and proactive components. These elements complemented and reinforced each other, fostering environmental awareness and community engagement.

As part of the educational component, we trained 34 eco-mentors who delivered environmental lectures in 34 city schools. Demonstration stands were installed, and 5 sorting stations were set up. Additionally, 34 school coordinators were trained.

The second component focused on a citywide information campaign, including media and social media content, press conferences, and the forum "It’s Time for Sorter".
