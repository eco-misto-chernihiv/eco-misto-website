  <Badge>The Process</Badge>

At the Peremoha Startup and Innovation Center of Chernihiv Polytechnic National University, students studied the principles of tactical urbanism and applied them in practice by redesigning the square near the center.

The project involved students of "Construction and Civil Engineering", "Architecture and Urban Planning", "Environmental Design", and "Geodesy and Land Management" as well as young people interested in urbanism and eager to help transform public spaces.

The students carried out a participatory study and developed an architectural concept for the transformation, guided by architect Oleksandr Tsupor. Five online lectures were held, where participants learned about the fundamentals of tactical urbanism, successful case studies from Ukraine, implementation stages, and methods of involving communities in transforming public spaces.

Volunteers joined the hands-on workshops to improve the square near the Peremoha Center, helping build small architectural elements, plant trees and perennials, and pour concrete for a path connecting the sidewalk to the square — making the area more inclusive.
