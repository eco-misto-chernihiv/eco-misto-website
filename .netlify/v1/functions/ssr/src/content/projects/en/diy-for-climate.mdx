  <Badge>The Process</Badge>
The project lasted four months, uniting youth from four countries to help cities adapt to climate change and reduce their carbon footprint. It brought together 24 young community representatives from Germany, Ukraine, Moldova, and Belarus. In the first stage, participants joined an online meet-up with a facilitator to lay the groundwork for effective collaboration. This was followed by three educational webinars focused on the challenges of climate change and ways cities can adapt.

The highlight of the project was a 7-day training exchange in Berlin, where participants learned to implement DIY solutions for urban sustainability. After returning home, they organized practical workshops in their communities — sharing knowledge and engaging local residents in environmental action.

To share the outcomes, seven themed videos and a multilingual guide titled "DIY Solutions for Urban Gardening" were created and made accessible to all interested audiences. The project concluded with an online forum where participants presented their achievements and shared future plans.
