Communities selected through an open call received expert assessments of their cycling infrastructure and strategic development plans. Specifically, the Nizhyn, Varva, and Kulykivka communities received refurbished European bicycles, bike racks, and maintenance stations."]

Volunteers at the workshop have already repaired 240 European bikes, which have been distributed to social workers, medics, humanitarian volunteers, and paramedics. Such community bike repair spaces are a novelty in Ukraine — and still rare even across Europe."
