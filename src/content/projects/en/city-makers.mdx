  <Badge>The Process</Badge>

Based at the Peremoha Center for Startups and Innovation at Chernihiv Polytechnic National University, students explored modern technologies and used their newly gained knowledge to create their own project works focused on the recovery and development of Chernihiv.

The target audience included university students majoring in "Construction and Civil Engineering", "Architecture and Urban Planning", "Environmental Design", and "Geodesy and Land Management" — as well as proactive young people eager to join the educational course offered by the project.

The program featured excursions, lectures, and hands-on workshops on modeling, laser cutting, 3D printing, 3D scanning, and recycling.

The "City Makers" Forum was the final event, showcasing the results of the course and models of real urban concept projects developed using the digital tools of the Peremoha Center. Guest speakers highlighted the importance of youth engagement in the recovery and reconstruction of cities, while interactive zones offered visitors the chance to try out VR technology and work hands-on with a CNC plotter.
