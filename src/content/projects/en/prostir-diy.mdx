  <Badge>The Process</Badge>

Over the past decade, grassroots initiatives that transform urban environments using bottom-up tools have been on the rise globally. One such method is DIY urbanism (from the English "do it yourself") — a key practice within the framework of tactical urbanism. Our project, "DIY Space", became a local example of this approach in Chernihiv.

We reimagined and revitalized the campus of Chernihiv Polytechnic National University through the efforts of young urbanists, artists, and designers. Using participatory research, co-design, tactical urbanism, and street art, we created a vibrant creative hub. This sparked momentum for new urban initiatives and creative public spaces across the city.
