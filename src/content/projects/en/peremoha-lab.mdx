  The first renovated space of the former cinema is Peremoha Lab — an
  open-access workshop equipped with digital tools such as 3D printers, laser
  cutters, CNC machines, and more. Established in 2023, the lab was revived
  through the efforts of local volunteers, students, and the Tolocar project. It
  complements academic education at Chernihiv Polytechnic National University
  and inspires the community to carry out hands-on, project-based work.

  <Badge>Our Approach</Badge>
  A Fab Lab (short for *fabrication laboratory*) is a workshop concept that provides access to a variety of digital tools, including 3D printers, laser cutters, CNC milling machines, and other equipment that allows users to create almost any physical object from various materials. It's a space where people with different skill levels can bring their ideas, prototypes, projects, and inventions to life.

The Fab Lab concept was developed in 2001 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) under the direction of Professor Neil Gershenfeld. The first Fab Lab was launched as part of the course "How to Make (Almost) Anything", where students could work independently on their projects using available tools.

Today, Fab Labs have spread worldwide, forming a global network that connects thousands of people and organizations. They play a key role in advancing STEM education (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), bridging the gap between theory and hands-on skills.

### How Can a Fab Lab Boost Innovation?

Peremoha Lab plays a key role in fostering startups and innovation through its accessibility, creative support, and rapid prototyping capabilities. We provide access to high-end CNC equipment, enabling users to test, adjust, and improve their ideas early in the development process—helping reduce both risks and costs.

Peremoha Lab is also a community hub where people from different fields—designers, engineers, programmers, entrepreneurs—come together. This fosters collaboration and idea-sharing, paving the way for fresh innovations. Startups can find partners, get expert advice, or even attract investment.

**Peremoha Lab empowers the university to take an active role in nurturing creativity and technological entrepreneurship across the region.**
