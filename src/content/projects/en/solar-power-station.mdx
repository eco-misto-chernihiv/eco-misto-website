  <Badge>The Process</Badge>

A 15 kW hybrid solar power station was installed at the «Peremoha» Center for Startups and Innovation as part of a sustainability-focused project. The installation began during a two-day hands-on workshop in collaboration with the mobile maker space #TOLOCAR, where veterans, volunteers, and Chernihiv residents learned how to work with solar panels—from preparing structures to installing the full system. In addition to practical tasks, participants also completed a short theoretical module on how solar systems work and the basics of safety regulations.

<span>«</span>I was really interested in this initiative because the field of renewable energy is very promising. I wanted to see the process with my own eyes so that in the future, I can share this experience with fellow veterans and encourage others to get involved in similar projects.<span>»</span>

After the workshop, the installation continued with the involvement of volunteer organizations such as Repair Together, BUR Chernihiv, students of Chernihiv Polytechnic, and the NGO «Eco Misto». As part of the project, 56 used solar panels were installed—sourced from the Czech Republic through the Sun for Ukraine humanitarian initiative, supported by NESEHNUTÍ and the company FEČ s.r.o. The 20 kW hybrid inverters and batteries were funded by the European Endowment for Democracy, while additional materials were purchased using a special university fund.

The result of this collaborative effort was the creation of a clean energy source that now powers the Peremoha Lab autonomously and provides backup energy support for the Center’s shelter. This solution strengthens the building’s resilience to potential power outages and ensures safer conditions for both students and community members.
