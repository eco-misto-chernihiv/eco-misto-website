  <Badge>The Goal</Badge>
  ## To collect and properly dispose of used batteries in order to reduce environmental pollution caused by toxic heavy metals.
  
  The idea emerged in response to the widespread issue of improper battery disposal, which leads to soil and water contamination by hazardous substances.

  <Badge>The Process</Badge>
This project aimed to raise environmental awareness among Chernihiv residents, promoting responsible waste handling and the collection of used batteries to reduce pollution.

Over the course of four months, we reached more than 70,000 people through an information campaign and surveys to gather public opinions on waste issues. Special attention was given to educational activities, particularly training sessions for eco-mentors who became ambassadors of the project in their schools and educational institutions.

  We held 180 lectures for school students, reaching over 3,000 children. One of
  the project’s key achievements was organizing the collection of used batteries
  in all schools across Chernihiv, where special containers were installed for
  convenience. The eco game "Eco Battle. Plan B" gained great popularity —
  students could exchange used batteries for eco-coins and receive gifts, which
  significantly boosted their motivation to participate.

The project concluded with the "Time for Plan B" forum, which brought together over 200 participants. It served as an important platform for sharing experiences and discussing new ideas for environmental initiatives in Chernihiv. The project not only raised awareness about waste-related issues, but also sparked real change within the community.
