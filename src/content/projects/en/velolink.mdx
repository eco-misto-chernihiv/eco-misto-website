  <Badge>The Process</Badge>

The NGO Eco Misto and the company Glovo, in cooperation with the Chernihiv City Council, implemented a joint infrastructure project for cyclists and city residents as part of a signed Memorandum of Cooperation. This is the first comprehensive public space project of its kind in Ukraine, developed using tools and methods of tactical urbanism.

The urban zone design was developed by the "Ostriv" platform in line with Glovo’s visual identity, incorporating its signature yellow and green colors.

The project is part of Glovo Acts, a long-term sustainability initiative for Ukrainian cities, aimed at improving public spaces.
