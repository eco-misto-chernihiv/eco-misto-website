  ## To grow Chernihiv’s urbanist community by engaging young people in hands-on activities in the public space near the «Peremoha» Center.

  <Badge>The Process</Badge>

Based at the «Peremoha» Center for Startups and Innovation of Chernihiv Polytechnic National University, the Urban Studio project brought together education, hands-on practice, and urban environment engagement. The initiative involved young people in revitalizing the area around the center and applying the principles of tactical urbanism in real-life conditions.

Participants included university students majoring in Construction and Civil Engineering, Architecture and Urban Planning, Environmental Design, and Geodesy and Land Management, as well as active youth from Chernihiv and other cities interested in urbanism, contemporary city development, and contributing to the creation of sustainable urban spaces.

Before starting practical work, the team – together with Liubov Dombrovska – explored previous interventions implemented as part of the Urban Vision project and created a situational map combining existing solutions with new development ideas for the area.

  As part of the project, six online lectures were held on topics such as
  tactical urbanism, greening, and climate-resilient landscapes. During the
  hands-on workshops, participants improved the site by removing concrete slabs,
  planting trees and perennial plants, enhancing accessibility, and installing
  informational stands to introduce residents to the sustainable transformation
  process of the space.

  The final stage of the project was the two-day festival «A City with Meaning»,
  which brought together over 300 participants – students, architects,
  volunteers, and guests from various cities across Ukraine and abroad. The
  festival served as a culmination of collective efforts, transforming the
  renewed space near the «Peremoha» Center into an open area for interaction,
  learning, and inspiration. The program featured performances by three music
  bands, screenings of three documentary films, a Chair Bombing workshop, and
  the planting of a continuous-bloom garden.
